## Variables
Primitives............. Compound Data
ex: 5, true, abdc ..... Arrays [] <b>&</b> Objects {}


let & const are used to declare variables
use LET, If you plan to change it later
useCONST otherwise

Arrays (lists).............. Objects (dictionaries)
const arr = [1,2,3] ........ const obj = {name:"Steve", age: 33}
